This is a fork of dokan.

<h3>Improved:</h3>

<li>I have made a Visual Studio(2010) solution file. Now, you can compile filesystem driver easily.</li>
<li>dokan library dll was written by C. Now, you can use C++.</li>
<li>Original dokan provided mirrorfs to test the library. I will write virtual file system. It would be better than mirrorfs.</li>
