This is a fork of dokan.

<h3>Improved:</h3>
1. I have made a Visual Studio(2010) solution file. Now, you can compile filesystem driver easily.<br />
2. dokan library dll was written by C. Now, you can use C++.<br />
3. Original dokan provided mirrorfs to test the library. I will write virtual file system. It would be better than mirrorfs.<br />
