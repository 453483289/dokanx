This is a fork of dokan.

Improved:
- I have made a Visual Studio(2010) solution file. Now, you can compile filesystem driver easily.
- dokan library dll was written by C. Now, you can use C++.
- Original dokan provided mirrorfs to test the library. I will write virtual file system. It would be better than mirrorfs.
